These are the instructions I followed to finish this simple website

Build a ASP.NET Core MVC Web App about a hobby of yours. Start with the
ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)” template. (NOTE: Feel free to
remove anything that was built by the template that you do not want/need.) The
app will consist of two views. The first view will be all about your hobby. It
should include at least:
• A title on the tab of the web page
• A custom icon next to the title on the web page 
• A heading that introduces your site
• At least two images
• A few paragraphs talking about your hobby
• A footer on the page that has a copyright and info about who built the page
• Navigation to the second page 
The second view should be a simple calculator that allows the user to figure out
how much you would charge for your services to help tutor them about your
hobby. The view should use a JavaScript file using jQuery to complete the
calculation. This view should include:
• A box for the user to enter the number of hours they need from you
• Validation to make sure they actually entered a positive number
• An non-editable box that shows how much you charge per hour
• A button that allows the user to calculate the total
• An output box that shows the total
• Navigation back to the home page
The look of the site (title, icon, heading, footer, etc.) should be consistent across
both pages to create one cohesive flow.
